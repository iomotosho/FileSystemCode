This project was written in Python to simulate an OS File System.
What it is doing here is defining 3 classes File, FileSystem, and Directory
In the File class we are asking the code to create a file in the directory
In the Directory class we are creating a directory
In the File System class we are simulating a file system navigation (cd, ls, touch, mkdir) using if else conditions.

To run the project:
Make sure Python is installed on your system. 
Clone this repository to your local machine
Open a terminal and navigate to the directory where you've saved the python code.
Run the main Python script, "python filesystem.py".

To run tests of the project:
Navigate to your terminal and run the following command, python -m unittest discover tests.
This will discover adn run all test cases present.
